# Project-React-Pokemon
My project aims to practice using the React library to create a SPA-style website, in which I consume an API fetching pokemon data and using it in the project.

## technologies used

### React

ReactJS is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for web and mobile app development. Created by Facebook, React contains a collection of reusable JavaScript code snippets called components, used to build the user interface (UI).

### React Router Dom

The React Router Dom is a library for React with the objective of solving routing problems for the pages of a website and making the development simpler and scalable. With it, we can declare paths of our site to render components, it makes the site SPA 'single page application'.

### Styled Components

Styled-components is a library for React that allows you to use component-level styles in your application. They are written in a mixture of JavaScript and CSS.

### Jest

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure the correctness of any JavaScript code. It allows you to write tests with an accessible API, it is used to run tests in the project.

### Context API

Context API is a React library, it is used in cases such as local preferences or UI theme, which are used by many components, facilitating the use of props in them.


## utilities of the above tools

 #### React Router Dom -
 I used this tool to create SPA-style routes, and make loading pages in the application lighter and faster.
 #### Context API - 
 This tool was used to create a theme context in my application, where the dark and light theme are alternated on the site.
 #### Styled Components
 I chose this tool to style my site because it avoids errors with classes, has a dynamic styling and renders only what is necessary.
 #### Jest -
 This tool reduces the chances of possible errors in the creation and implementation of codes in the application, I used it to do a battery of unit tests.
 #### Local Storage -
 I used this method to save the user's preferences information on the site, so that
 if he refreshes the page or exits, the data is still saved in the browser.
